        <h2>About The Team</h2>
        <p>The Detroit Lions are one of the oldest franchises in the National Football League (NFL), having been founded in 1929 as the Portsmouth Spartans.</p>
        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Lions were the first NFL team to play on Thanksgiving Day. This tradition started in 1934, and the Lions have played on Thanksgiving every year since</li>
            <li>The Lions had one of the most dominant players in NFL history in running back Barry Sanders. Sanders played for the Lions from 1989 to 1998 and rushed for over 1,000 yards in each of his 10 seasons with the team. He retired abruptly after the 1998 season, at the age of 30, and is considered by many to be one of the greatest running backs of all time.</li>
            <li>The Lions have a rivalry with their divisional opponent, the Green Bay Packers, that dates back to the 1930s. The two teams have played each other more than 170 times, and the rivalry is known for being intense and physical.</li>
            <li>The Lions have had a number of famous coaches over the years, including Joe Schmidt, who coached the team in the 1960s and led them to three NFL championships, and Wayne Fontes, who coached the team in the 1990s and led them to their last playoff win in 1991.</li>

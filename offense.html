        <p>
          To be successful on offense, a team typically needs a strong
          quarterback who can make accurate and timely passes, a skilled
          offensive line that can protect the quarterback and open up holes for
          the running game, and talented receivers who can catch the ball and
          gain yards after the catch. It remains to be seen how the Detroit
          Lions offense will perform in 2023, as a lot can change in the world
          of professional football and this will be the team to do it.
